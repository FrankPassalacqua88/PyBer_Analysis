# PyBer Analysis with Pandas and Matplotlib

## Overview of Project
 
### Purpose

The purpose of the project is to analyze rideshare data using Pandas and Matplotlib. The goal of the analysis is to summarize raw data in a DataFrame and chart.

## Results

### PyBer Analysis Results

There were differences found across the 3 different types of environments. The environments types consist of Rural, Suburban, and Urban. There are distinct trends found analyzing the data (see table below). The following trends can be found when evaluating the environments in the order of Rural to Suburban to Urban:

- Total Riders, Drivers, and Fares increase

- Average Fare per Ride and Driver decreases

The line chart generated confirms the trend shown in Total Fares column of the summary table. Is can also be seen that total fare trends in the same direction week to week regardless of environment.

## Summary

Based on the results the following are recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types:

- There are more riders in urban areas then drivers. Drivers need to be influenced to move to leas populated areas where their services can be utilized.

- Where there are spikes in demand there needs to be a way to ensure there are enough drivers.

- Having more drivers in Rural areas will driver prices down making it more affordable to use the service. This will hopefully drive up demand.
